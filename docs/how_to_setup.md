# How to setup the repo with Azure DevOps

This template supports Azure ML as a platform for ML, and Azure DevOps as a platform for operationalization. Therefore, we assume that you already have an Azure ML Workspace as well as an Azure DevOps project in place, and all the code from the repository has been cloned into the DevOps project.

In order to setup the repository, you need to complete few steps.

**Step 1.** Create a service connection in Azure DevOps. You can use [this document](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/service-endpoints?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml) as a reference. Use Azure Resource Manager as a type of the service connection.

**Step 2.** Create a new variable group with the following variables:

- EXPERIMENT_BASE_NAME: an experiment base name. This parameter as well as two more parameters below we are using as a background to form unique names for experiments, runs and models. You can find a rule for the names in [this template](../devops/pipeline/templates/experiment_variables.yml). By default we are using the branch name as well as build id to form the names that helps us to differentiate experiments, runs and models working in a big team of data scientists and software engineers. The EXPERIMENT_TYPE variable from the template is hard coded in _dev_pipeline.yml files.
- DISPLAY_BASE_NAME: a run base name (see EXPERIMENT_BASE_NAME for details).
- MODEL_BASE_NAME: a model base name (see EXPERIMENT_BASE_NAME for details).
- AZURE_RM_SVC_CONNECTION: the service connection name from the previous step.
- WORKSPACE_NAME: an Azure ML workspace name.
- RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME: a resource group where Azure Ml Workspace is located.
- CLUSTER_NAME: an Azure ML compute cluster name to start jobs.
- CLUSTER_SIZE: a size of the cluster in Azure ML to start jobs.
- CLUSTER_REGION: a location/region where the cluster should be created.
- ENVIRONMENT_NAME: a name of the Azure ML environment.
- ENV_BASE_IMAGE_NAME: a base image for the environment (ex.: mcr.microsoft.com/azureml/openmpi3.1.2-ubuntu18.04).
- CONDA_PATH: a location of the conda file (mlops/nyc_taxi/environment/conda.yml).

Information about variable groups in Azure DevOps can be found in [this document](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/variable-groups?view=azure-devops&tabs=classic).

**Step 3.** Create a *development* branch and make it as default one to make sure that all PRs should go towards to it. This template assumes that the team works at a *development* branch as a primary source for coding and improving the model quality. Later, you can implement an Azure Pipeline that enables on-demand or automated promotion of code to qa/prod. Release management is not in scope of this template.

**Step 4.** Create two Azure Pipelines. Both Azure Pipelines should be created based on the existing YAML files in the repository. The first one is based on the [ny_taxi_pr_dev_pipeline.yml](../devops/pipeline/ny_taxi_pr_dev_pipeline.yml), and it helps to maintain code quality for all PRs including integration tests for the Azure ML experiment. Usually, we recommend to have a test dataset for the integration tests to make sure that the Azure ML job can be completed in a timely manner - the integration test is not to check model quality but, rather, to make sure that the job can be executed. The second Azure Pipeline is based on [ny_taxi_ci_dev_pipeline.yml](../devops/pipeline/ny_taxi_ci_dev_pipeline.yml) that should be executed automatically once new PR has been merged into the *development* branch. The main idea of this pipeline is to execute training on the full dataset to generate a model that can be a candidate for production. This Azure Pipeline should be extended based on the project's requirements. 

More details about how to create a basic Azure Pipeline can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/create-first-pipeline?view=azure-devops&tabs).

**Step 5.** Setup a policy for the *development* branch. At this stage we have an Azure Pipeline that should be executed on every PR to the *development* branch. At the same time successful completion of the build is not a requirement. So, it's important to add our PR build as a policy. Pay special attention that pr_to_dev_pipeline.yml](../devops/pipeline/pr_to_dev_pipeline.yml) has various paths in place. We are using these paths to limit number of runs if the current PR doesn't affect ML component (for example, PR modifies a documentation file). Therefore, setting up the policy you need to make sure that you are using the same set of paths in the *Path filter* field.

More details about how to create a policy can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/branch-policies?view=azure-devops&tabs=browser).

**Step 6. (Optional)** It's a common practice to execute a training job on the full dataset once a PR has been merged into the development branch. At the same time, the training process can take much time (many hours or even days) and Azure DevOps agent will not be able to let you know about the status due to timeout settings. So, it's very hard to implement a single CI Build that is waiting for a new model (training results) and execute other steps after that (model approval, model movement into qa environment, model deployment etc).

Azure ML provides a solution that allows us to implement a *server* task in Azure DevOps Build and wait for the result of the pipeline training job with no Azure DevOps agent holding. Thanks to that it's possible to wait for results any amount of time and execute all other steps right after completion of the Azure ML training job. As for now, the feature is in active development, but you can [visit this link](https://github.com/Azure/azure-mlops-automation) to check the status and find how to get access. This new Azure ML feature can be included in your CI Build thanks to the extension that Azure ML team built or you can use RestAPITask for a direct REST call. In this template we implemented a version with the extension.

Now, you can create a PR and test the flow.

# How to setup the repo with Github Workflow

This template supports Azure ML as a platform for ML, and Github Workflow as a platform for operationalization. Therefore, we assume that you already have an Azure ML Workspace as well as a Github Repository in place, and all the code from this repository has been made available to it.

In order to setup the repository, you need to complete the steps below.

**Step 1.** Create a secret named "AXURE_CREDENTIALS" in Github repository. You can use [this document](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/github/connect-from-azure?tabs=azure-portal%2Clinux#use-the-azure-login-action-with-a-service-principal-secret) as a reference. 

**Step 2.** Create repository variables with the following variables:

- EXPERIMENT_BASE_NAME: an experiment base name. This parameter as well as two more parameters below we are using as a background to form unique names for experiments, runs and models. You can find a rule for the names in [this template](../devops/pipeline/templates/experiment_variables.yml). By default we are using the branch name as well as build id to form the names that helps us to differentiate experiments, runs and models working in a big team of data scientists and software engineers. The EXPERIMENT_TYPE variable from the template is hard coded in _dev_pipeline.yml files.
- DISPLAY_BASE_NAME: a run base name (see EXPERIMENT_BASE_NAME for details).
- MODEL_BASE_NAME: a model base name (see EXPERIMENT_BASE_NAME for details).
- AZURE_RM_SVC_CONNECTION: the service connection name from the previous step.
- WORKSPACE_NAME: an Azure ML workspace name.
- RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME: a resource group where Azure Ml Workspace is located.
- CLUSTER_NAME: an Azure ML compute cluster name to start jobs.
- CLUSTER_SIZE: a size of the cluster in Azure ML to start jobs.
- CLUSTER_REGION: a location/region where the cluster should be created.
- ENVIRONMENT_NAME: a name of the Azure ML environment.
- ENV_BASE_IMAGE_NAME: a base image for the environment (ex.: mcr.microsoft.com/azureml/openmpi3.1.2-ubuntu18.04).
- CONDA_PATH: a location of the conda file (mlops/nyc_taxi/environment/conda.yml).

Information about repository variable in Github Workflows can be found in [this document](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables#creating-configuration-variables-for-a-repository).

**Step 3.** Create a *development* branch and make it as default one to make sure that all PRs should go towards to it. This template assumes that the team works at a *development* branch as a primary source for coding and improving the model quality. Later, you can implement Azure Pipeline that mode code from the *development* branch into qa/main or execute a release process right away. Release management is not in scope of this template.

**Step 4.** Create two Azure Pipelines. Both Azure Pipelines should be created based on existing YAML files. The first one is based on the [ny_taxi_pr_dev_pipeline.yml](../.github/workflows/ny_taxi_pr_dev_pipeline.yml), and it helps to maintain code quality for all PRs including integration tests for the Azure ML experiment. Usually, we recommend to have a toy dataset for the integration tests to make sure that the Azure ML job can be completed fast enough - there is no a goal to check model quality and we just need to make sure that our job can be executed. The second Azure Pipeline is based on [ny_taxi_ci_dev_pipeline.yml](./.github/workflows/ny_taxi_ci_dev_pipeline.yml) that should be executed automatically once new PR has been merged into the *development* branch. The main idea of this pipeline is to execute training on the full dataset to generate a model that can be a candidate for production. This Azure Pipeline should be extended based on the project's requirements. 

More details about how to create a basic Github Workflow can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart#creating-your-first-workflow).

**Important** Github Actions does not support server jobs similar to Azure DevOps and native callbacks from Azure Machine learning workflows are not supported. Callbacks are not supported using this template alongside Github Actions however they are supported with Azure Devops.

Now, you can create a PR and test the flow.
