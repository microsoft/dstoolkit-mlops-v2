"""
This module is designed to facilitate the creation and management of Azure Machine Learning environments.

It leverages the Azure AI ML Client for communicating with Azure ML services, enabling users to create or
update machine learning environments in an Azure subscription. The module provides functionality to
authenticate with Azure, define environment specifications, and perform environment setup or updates.
