# Contributing to Model Factory

Welcome to Model Factory! We greatly appreciate your interest in contributing to our project. Please follow the guidelines below to ensure a smooth and successful contribution process.


## Fork the Repository
To get started, fork the dstoolkit-mlops-v2 main repository to your own GitHub account by clicking on the "Fork" button at the top right corner of the repository page. This will create a copy of the repository under your account, which you can freely make changes to.

## Clone the Repository
Next, clone the forked repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/[your-github-username]/[your-repository-name].git
```

Make sure to replace [your-github-username] with your actual GitHub username and [your-repository-name] with the name of your forked repository.

## Set Up Access to Relevant Services
Please ensure that you have the appropriate permissions and credentials to avoid any issues during the contribution process. This includes Azure DevOps project, repository, pipelines and Azure Subscription. If your contribution requires access to Azure Machine Learning compute, make sure you have the necessary permissions and access before proceeding with your changes.  

## Install Dependencies and Validate Environment
Before making changes, ensure that you have installed all the dependencies required for the project. This include Conda, Python 3.8 (ideal), azureml sdk v2 and tools. Validate that your development environment is set up correctly and meets the project's requirements.

## Create a Branch
Create a new branch for your contribution. It's important to create a new branch for each contribution to keep the main branch clean and stable. You can create a new branch using the following command:
```
git checkout -b [branch-name]
```

Replace [branch-name] with a descriptive name for your branch that indicates the purpose of your contribution.

## Make Changes
Now it's time to make your changes! Follow the coding style and guidelines of the project, and thoroughly test your changes in your local environment. Ensure that your changes do not introduce any errors or break the existing functionality. Be sure to add appropriate comments and documentation as needed.

## Validate code changes
Before submitting your contribution, it's crucial to validate your changes by building and testing the project on your environment. This includes running code quality checks, linting, unit tests, MLOps CI/CD and AzureML pipelines including training scripts, executing tests, or other validation processes. Make sure that your changes do not cause any build failures or test errors. 

## Commit and Push Changes
Once you're confident with your changes, commit your changes and push them to your forked repository using the following commands:

```
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
git push origin [branch-name]
```
Replace [branch-name] with the name of your branch.

## Create a Pull Request
Go to the original [Your Repository Name] repository on GitHub and click on the "New Pull Request" button. Select your branch from the base and compare branches drop-down menus. Review your changes and provide a descriptive title and detailed description for your pull request. Include relevant information, such as the purpose of your contribution, the changes made, and any necessary context. Click on the "Create Pull Request" button to submit your contribution.

## Validate Builds and Tests
After PR is created, build validation must pass before the code can be merged on the target develop branch. Any feedback from build validation must be addressed or else the PR will not get merged to target develop branch. 

## Review and Address Feedback
Your pull request will be reviewed by the repository maintainers, and they may provide feedback or request changes. Be sure to monitor your pull request and address any feedback in a timely manner. This may involve making additional changes, providing clarification, or addressing any issues raised during the review process.

## Follow Code of Conduct
As a contributor, it's important to adhere to the project's code of conduct. Make sure to follow the project's guidelines, respect the contributions of others, and avoid any inappropriate behavior. Additionally, ensure that your contribution does not violate any copyright or intellectual property rights.

## Merge and Close
Once your contribution has been approved and all feedback has been addressed, you should merge your changes into the develop branch. After the changes have been merged, your contribution will be credited and acknowledged in the project's documentation or contributors list. Your pull request will then be closed, and your contribution will become part of the project's codebase.
